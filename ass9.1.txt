1. What is the difference between Internal Storage and External Storage?

--> Internal Storage -
                  
      * it is always available.
      * files saved here are accessible by only your app.
      * when the user uninstalls your app, the system removes all your app's files from internal storage.
      * it is best when we want to be sure that neither the user nor other apps can access your files.
   
    External Storage -
 
      * it is not always available, because the user can mount the external storage as USB storage and in some cases remove it from the device.
      * it is world-readable, so files saved here may be read outside of your control.
      * when the user uninstalls your app, the system removes your app's files from here only if you save them in the directory from getExternalFilesDir().
      * External Storage is best place for files that dont require access restrictions and for files that you want to share with other apps or allow the user to access 
          with a computer.



2. For how long the data resides in the cache?

-->  Data in Cache Remains till the time user is not clearing the cache or clear data from the settings. If data in cache is stored through server side then we can code in our app for how long we want the data to stay in cache or it can be return from server side as well in headers.



3. What are critical Permissions and Normal Permissions? What are the examples of each?

-->   System permissions are divided into several protection levels. The two most important protection levels to know about are normal and dangerouspermissions:
Normal permissions cover areas where your app needs to access data or resources outside the app's sandbox, but where there's very little risk to the user's privacy or the operation of other apps. For example, permission to set the time zone is a normal permission. If an app declares that it needs a normal permission, the system automatically grants the permission to the app. For a full listing of the current normal permissions, see Normal permissions.
Dangerous permissions cover areas where the app wants data or resources that involve the user's private information, or could potentially affect the user's stored data or the operation of other apps. For example, the ability to read the user's contacts is a dangerous permission. If an app declares that it needs a dangerous permission, the user has to explicitly grant the permission to the app.
